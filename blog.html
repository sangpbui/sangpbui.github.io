                    Rushing everywhere to get things done like classic Sang, the “King of Last Minute” :) My mom is right, 9 out of 10 trips 
                    I am always the last person to get ready haha.  (I miss you mom, even if you complain about the way I do things). The best 
                    thing I did this morning was say goodbye to my Rec family. It’s the place that I have been working consistently for the last 
                    two and a half years. Not just during the school year but during winter break and summer too! I love it so much and I know I 
                    will miss it this summer. It will be the first time I won’t work there for a while.  It’s like going away from home for the 
                    first time :(
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Food on the train is terrible.  Anyhow, I was so hungry and had to pay a lot of money for Amtrak food but it’s so bad.  
                    If I could intensify how bad it was it still wouldn’t be close to the reality. I couldn’t finish even though I was starving.
                    Also, are you kidding me? Chicken nuggets with ranch! Really!  I mean really! Get it together American haha :) BBQ sauce or 
                    honey mustard normally I would say even.  But I would rather eat them instead of ranch. Come on! I’m still feeling the food 
                    stuck in my chest after two hours...Eww! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Traveling and I don’t get along very well! That is the fact! Ever since I knew what cars were I have been suffering from car 
                    sickness. It was so bad when I was in grade school.  So bad that the moment I got in the car I got sick right away.  My grandpa 
                    always took care of me whenever we traveled together.  I really miss him.  It’s been three years that I haven’t seen him, three 
                    years too long.  He is the one that encourages me to study abroad, the one that taught me so many things in life from how to write 
                    the first letters, from how to live as a man with dignity, and from how to appreciate family.  His health has not been good recently, 
                    his mind is acting badly, and I just wish to see him soon.  I really wish so!  That’s a bit sidetracked but I will never forget the 
                    times that he told stories to me at night with just candles when the electricity was out.  The interesting stories about his life 
                    while he was in the army, stories in the jungle, under the river and up on the hill.  I love listening to his stories so much that 
                    recently I realized I want to work in a field that connects people together by life stories, like Humans of New York. I miss you, grandpa!

                    <br>
                    Last night I stayed at Nadine’s house.  It felt so cozy to be with a family in a house like that.  It’s been awhile that I have felt 
                    the warmth and care of a family! Living far away from home for so long, sometimes if feels so empty inside whenever I think about family.  
                    Sometimes I just need a pat on the back from my dad to encourage me! Sometimes a hug from my mom would warm up the freezing night of 
                    the miserable winter.  Oh! Nadine has two little brothers; can you believe that? Maybe because she’s joyful and has a big smile all the time, 
                    well kinda cute too :) What she’s doing this summer is amazing! I admire what she’s doing.  Everyday she works with her boss, a lady she 
                    knows from church, to apply for grants to support the kids.  Isn’t that amazing? I forgot to mention she works for free to help people.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just like last night, she and her Dad had to drive all the way to pick me up at the Amtrak train station so late at night.  He was so 
                    impressed that I am going to ride a bike across the country! Woohoo! I love that I could share the spirit to people.  It’s funny the way 
                    he said, “I hope that you have cycling shorts with you! Right? Otherwise your butt would be so painful after the ride” haha :) Yes sir, 
                    I sure have cycling shorts.  Thanks for reminding me Chicago is such a big place.  Cars are everywhere and especially the people - never 
                    have I seen so many - Latinos at the airport, they are everywhere, at the checked bag station, driving golf carts, security guards, 
                    cafeteria, you name it! Seeing this really encourages me to learn Spanish. I tried, not very much, but I could probably say something 
                    by the time I’m 30 - that’s my goal.
