The site hosts my portfolio and updates about my bike ride across America in support of cancer patients

Hello,
My name is Sang Bui. I study computer science at TSU. This summer I will spend 70 days 
bicycling across America to support young adults who are fighting cancer.

The 4,000-mile journey will take me from Baltimore, MD to Seattle WA in an effort to 
raise money for the Ulman Cancer Fund. My goal is to raise at least $4,500 by Aug. 12, 
2017.

I was inspired to participate in cross-country bike ride after working through some 
difficult times myself in the past year, and then stumbled upon stories of people who 
are in much more challenging situation than mine, yet they had not given up. Therefore, 
I decide to embark on a journey that takes me to new places, meet inspiring people and 
give back to the community.
